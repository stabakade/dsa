// remember to check if we need to keep track of array values when doing shifting

// when doing insertion and deletion, always keep track of the length of the array where there are values, and while shifting and deleting,
we will use that length variable in our for loop

// remember to check if we need to skip one pointer when inserted in somewhere middle of the array. e.g. solution to duplicate the zeroes in array
class Solution {
    public void duplicateZeros(int[] arr) {
        int l = arr.length;
        int lenIndex = arr.length-1;
        for(int i=0; i < l; i++){
            if (arr[i]==0 && l>1){
                for (int j =l-2; j >= i; j--){
                    arr[j+1] = arr[j];
                }
                i += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

// when you take condition, both arrays should be non empty with pointers m and n, you can do

while (m > 0 && n > 0) also take condition when one array is finished i. e. while (n > 0)

// remember to use in place deletions using readPointer and writePointer
only move writePointer when a value is written at that position
